ðŸ”§ Phase 1: Scoping & Requirements
Objectives:
Generate a virtual walkthrough (3D or interactive panoramic) using standard property photos.

Accept unordered or semi-structured image inputs (interior, exterior).

Support web and/or mobile deployment.

Must-Have Features:
Photo uploader (drag & drop or batch import)

AI-powered room recognition

Automatic room stitching into 3D or panoramic views

Basic navigation UI (forward/back through rooms, minimap optional)

ðŸ§  Phase 2: Tech Stack Selection
Core AI:
Structure-from-Motion (SfM): COLMAP, OpenMVG (photo to 3D reconstruction)

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF): Instant-NGP or NVIDIA NeRF for photorealistic walkthroughs

Depth Estimation Models:

MiDaS (for single-image depth estimation)

DPT (Dense Prediction Transformers)

Backend:
Python (Flask/FastAPI)

GPU server or cloud (AWS/GCP with GPU-enabled instances)

Frontend:
React + Three.js (for rendering 3D/360 tours)

Tailwind or shadcn/ui (for styling and clean UI)

Storage:
AWS S3 / Firebase Storage for image hosting

PostgreSQL / Firebase Firestore for metadata

ðŸ§ª Phase 3: Development Breakdown
1. Image Ingestion
Build uploader UI with drag & drop

Auto-categorize images by room using:

CLIP (to classify contextually)

YOLOv8 (for object detection â€” beds, sinks, etc.)

2. 3D Scene Generation
Use COLMAP to generate sparse & dense point clouds

Optionally: refine with Instant-NGP for NeRF rendering

Combine NeRF output with metadata (room labels, angles)

Alternative MVP:

Use MiDaS to extract depth per image â†’ project into pseudo-3D panoramas using WebGL

3. Tour Navigation Engine
Construct a room graph:

Nodes = Rooms

Edges = Hallways, Doorways, or spatial transitions

User can click arrows to navigate (like Google Street View)

Use Three.js or Babylon.js to render the camera transition with animations

4. UI/UX Design
Interactive floor plan (optional)

Map-based navigation bar

Hotspots to click and jump to a room

Mobile-responsive design with pinch/zoom

ðŸ¤– Phase 4: AI Enhancements
Room Labeling: NLP + Vision combo to auto-tag rooms ("Kitchen", "Master Bedroom")

Furniture Mapping: Detect and label major furniture

Lighting Correction: Enhance poorly lit photos with GAN-based light correction
