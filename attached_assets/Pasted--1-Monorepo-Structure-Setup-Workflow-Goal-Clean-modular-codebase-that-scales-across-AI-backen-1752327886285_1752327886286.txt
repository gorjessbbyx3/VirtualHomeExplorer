🧱 1. Monorepo Structure & Setup Workflow
Goal: Clean modular codebase that scales across AI, backend, and frontend.

🔧 Setup Structure:
bash
Copy
Edit
/virtual-tour-app
├── /frontend         ← React + Three.js
├── /backend          ← FastAPI/Flask + image processing
├── /ai_pipeline      ← NeRF, MiDaS, CLIP models
├── /services         ← Utils: file upload, auth, staging, narration
├── /scripts          ← Dev tools, CLI runners
├── /infrastructure   ← Docker, Terraform, CI/CD configs
Workflow:
Bootstrap each module as an isolated package

Use poetry (Python) and pnpm (JS) for dependency control

Use Docker compose to run the entire stack together for local dev

Start with dummy data fixtures for testing AI modules without UI first

🧠 2. AI/ML Model Development Workflow
Goal: Train, fine-tune, or deploy AI models modularly and reproducibly

Workflow:
Data Prep: Write a script to parse images into labeled folders (/ai_pipeline/data/rooms/bedroom/*.jpg)

Train/Test:

Use notebooks/ for quick iterations

Export to train.py, infer.py, and pipeline.py for production

Evaluation:

Log metrics using Weights & Biases or TensorBoard

Deployment:

Serve with FastAPI or TorchServe

Wrap in predict.py with unified input/output schema (e.g. JSON: { image_url, depth_map, tags })

⚙️ 3. Backend Development Workflow
Goal: Build APIs that can handle AI results and serve content to frontend

Workflow:
Define OpenAPI schema using FastAPI

Create endpoints:

POST /upload-images

GET /tour/{tour_id}

POST /generate-tour (triggers AI pipeline)

Use Celery or RQ for async task queuing (AI takes time)

Add auth (JWT or Firebase)

Write unit tests (pytest) + integration tests with Docker containers

🎨 4. Frontend Development Workflow (React + Three.js)
Goal: Build fast, immersive UI that integrates with the backend & AI

Workflow:
Create UI components:

<Uploader />

<VirtualTourViewer />

<RoomMap />

Use zustand or Redux for state management (especially room graph / transitions)

Integrate with Three.js:

Load glTF scenes

Animate camera between rooms

Overlay controls (arrows, buttons)

Connect with backend:

Fetch tour data

Render room views

Sync narration/audio

🚦 5. DevOps / CI/CD Workflow
Goal: Deploy often, debug less

Workflow:
Use GitHub Actions to:

Run tests (backend + frontend)

Build Docker images

Push to staging server

Auto-deploy branches to:

/staging → on main

/production → on release/*

Use preview links (e.g., Vercel or Netlify) for frontend PRs

🔁 6. Feature Branch Workflow (Code Contribution)
Goal: Keep everyone from stepping on each other’s toes

Branch Naming:
feat/upload-ai-model

fix/depth-map-scaling

chore/update-packages

Steps:
git checkout -b feat/3d-room-navigator

Make code changes

Push & open PR

Run test suite (auto)

Reviewer approves + auto-deploy to staging

Merge → deploy to prod on schedule

📜 7. AI Pipeline Trigger Workflow (End-to-End)
User uploads images via frontend

Backend stores images → fires task to queue (Celery/RQ)

AI pipeline loads model (e.g., MiDaS, NeRF) → processes images

Stores:

Depth maps

Room classification tags

3D assets (glTF)

Backend updates DB → notifies frontend via WebSocket or polling

Frontend re-renders virtual tour

🧪 Bonus: Testing Workflow
Frontend: Use Playwright for E2E, Vitest for unit

Backend: Pytest + FastAPI test client

AI:

Snapshot tests for depth maps, room tagging

Regression suite to ensure quality doesn’t degrade
