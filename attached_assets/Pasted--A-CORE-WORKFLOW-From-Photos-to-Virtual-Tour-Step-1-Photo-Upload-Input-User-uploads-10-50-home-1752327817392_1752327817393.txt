🔁 A. CORE WORKFLOW: From Photos to Virtual Tour
Step 1: Photo Upload
Input: User uploads 10–50 home photos (or zips a folder)

Process:

Validate resolution/format

Resize for thumbnails + AI processing

Store originals in cloud (e.g., S3)

Step 2: Scene Understanding
Detect:

Room types (bedroom, kitchen, etc.) using CLIP or custom classifier

Objects (e.g., sofa, oven, bed) using YOLOv8

Estimate depth (MiDaS) and focal length (EXIF fallback or AI)

Step 3: Room Segmentation & Ordering
Cluster photos into rooms

Generate basic spatial relationships between rooms (using visual similarity + estimated camera movement)

Optional: Auto-generate room graph

Step 4: Tour Assembly
Render stitched images or pseudo-3D with Three.js

Define navigation arrows and room transitions

Generate thumbnail map

Step 5: Frontend Integration
Display the tour in a WebGL/Three.js environment

Add controls: Next room, rotate, zoom, minimap, hotspots

Optional: Export as VR-compatible format (e.g., glTF)

🧠 B. ADVANCED AI WORKFLOW: From Static to Interactive Intelligence
Step 1: Neural Rendering (Optional)
Run Instant-NGP or NeRF pipeline (if using GPU backend)

Input: Ordered room photos or SfM point cloud from COLMAP

Output: Volumetric 3D tour

Step 2: Narration & Highlights
For each room:

Auto-generate description via GPT-4 Vision + Text

Convert to audio (ElevenLabs or Polly)

Tag key features: granite countertop, walk-in closet, etc.

Step 3: Virtual Staging (Optional)
User selects style (Modern, Rustic, etc.)

Images sent to Stable Diffusion or REimagineHome API

Replace room images with virtually staged versions

Step 4: Tour Personalization & Behavior Tracking
Capture user behavior:

Time spent per room

Clicked hotspots

Feed to AI model for lead scoring or dynamic content recommendations

Step 5: Multiplayer / Collaboration
Enable agent to join live and control viewer’s perspective

Enable comment threads, tags, and suggestions in tour UI

🏢 C. BUSINESS WORKFLOW: Real Estate Agent + Buyer Flow
Agent/Admin Portal
Create Listing:

Upload property photos

Set metadata: address, price, specs

Embed in MLS, send to buyers, share on social

Buyer Experience
Interact:

Walk through home

Hear AI narration

Toggle staging and lighting conditions

Engage:

Request showing

Ask AI questions (“Does this kitchen have quartz or granite?”)

Analytics Workflow
Capture:

Engagement scores per listing

Heatmaps (popular rooms/features)

Drop-off points

Report to agents weekly or real-time alerts (“🔥 3 buyers watched full tour”)
